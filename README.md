Centrale Data Science Course

This repository gathers the 3 Data science homework I had to do in my first 6 months. Both code commentary and report are written in French. The aim of those homeworks is to make us understand the maths hidden behind the pandas or sklearn functions we use everyday.

The first work is about reprogramming the Principal Components Analysis, Multiple Correspondance Analysis, Kmeans and Hierarchical Ascending Classification.

The second work is a basic logistic regression on the iris Data Set

The third work is a try of neural network development.
